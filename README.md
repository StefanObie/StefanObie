## Stefan Oberholzer

I am a Computer Engineer driven by a passion for solving complex engineering challenges. I am currently exploring opportunities in embedded systems or software development, with a strong focus on engineering problem-solving.

I have experience in a variety of programming languages, including Python for rapid development and C++ for low-level projects. I am eager to expand my skill set and take on new challenges, particularly in embedded systems and software engineering.

Feel free to check out my work. I am open to discussing new projects or opportunities.
